## 💝 A Personal Story

This project holds a special place in my heart. It was created for my father, who is hearing impaired, to help him convert audio messages, voice notes, and recordings into readable text. Watching him struggle to understand audio content inspired me to build something that could make his daily life easier.

**This is not just another project in my portfolio—it's one of my most cherished creations throughout my entire development journey.** Every line of code was written with purpose, every feature designed with empathy, and every bug fixed with determination. 

This app represents more than technology; it represents the power of using our skills to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those we love.

## 🖥️ Backend Setup

### Step 1: Navigate to Backend Directory

```bash
cd backend
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv myvenv
myvenv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv myvenv
source myvenv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
APP_SECRET=your_secure_secret_here
```

> **Generate a secure secret:**
> ```bash
> python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
> ```

### Step 5: Run the Backend Server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Backend will be available at: `http://localhost:8000`

## 🌐 Deployment

### Backend Deployment (Render)
Note: Since free hosting have limits try other backend hosting platforms like koyeb or try by creating a new email id for render or for other hosting platform you are familiar with. 

1. **Create a Render Account**: [render.com](https://render.com)
2. **Create a New Web Service**
3. **Connect Your GitHub Repository**
4. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
5. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your API key
   - `APP_SECRET`: Your secure secret
6. **Deploy!**

📖 **Detailed Guide**: See [backend/RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md](backend/RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md)

### Flutter App Deployment (Play Store)

1. **Generate Release Keystore**
2. **Configure Signing**
3. **Update Environment Variables** with production backend URL
